This project aims to develop tools for a translation chain and an emulator for an abstract computer system. The key components include:

Assembler: Translates user-written assembly code for the abstract computer system.
Linker: A linker that is architecture-independent, used to connect assembled modules.
Emulator: Executes the linked program.
The implementation will be demonstrated as a console application running on Linux. Note that the project is not compatible with Windows for defense purposes. The user program refers to the original assembly code processed by the assembler, linked by the linker, and executed by the emulator.
